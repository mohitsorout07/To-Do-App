# To-Do App (JavaScript Only)

This is a simple To-Do List App built using only HTML and JavaScript, with no CSS styling. It focuses purely on JavaScript functionality like DOM manipulation and local storage — ideal for beginners learning how to build dynamic web apps with raw JavaScript.

### Project Goals:
-Practice core JavaScript (no frameworks, no styling)<br> 
-Focus on logic, structure, and interactivity<br>
-Learn how to manipulate the DOM and store data locally

### Features:
-Add tasks<br>
-Delete individual tasks<br>
-Persistent data using localStorage

### How to Run:
-Download or clone the repository.<br>
-Open To-DoApp.html in any modern browser.<br>
-Use the app directly — no server or setup needed.

### Notes:
-No CSS is used — the layout and components are unstyled and purely functional.<br>
-Great for learning how JavaScript alone can build interactive web apps.
